# 🚗 Uber Request Data Analysis Project

This project performs a full-cycle analysis of Uber ride requests using **Excel, SQL, and Python (EDA)**.

## 📌 Problem Statement
**Predict high-risk time windows for driver cancellations and no-car availability using historical request patterns.**

## 🔧 Tools Used
- 🐍 Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- 📊 Excel Dashboard (Pivot Tables & Charts)
- 🧠 SQL (for pre-EDA insights)
- 📁 Google Colab (for EDA development)

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Uber_EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter/Colab notebook with full EDA (20+ charts, insights, comments)
- `Uber Request Data final.csv` – Cleaned dataset used in EDA
- `Uber Dashboard.xlsx` – Excel dashboard with univariate & bivariate charts
- `Uber_SQL_Insights.docx` – SQL queries & insights from pre-EDA phase

---

## ✅ Key Outcomes
- Identified failure-prone hours (5–9 AM, 5–9 PM)
- Isolated zone-specific issues (Airport = no cars, City = cancellations)
- Provided business recommendations to optimize driver deployment
